## Abstract

Our study used Multiple Linear Regression model to analyse the data set from General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017 for the relationship between income, the age of first marriage, and the age having first child. We found out that the age of having first child has a positive correlation with the age of first marriage and family income.


## Introduction

The paper is a detailed analysis of the relationship between sample's first marriage age & family income and  the age of having first child from General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017 of all the province of Canada by using Multiple Linear Regression. The goal is to find out that whether or not the age of first marriage and family income affect the age of first child, and the hypothesis is the age of having first child has a positive correlation with the age of first marriage and family income.

According to x value of family income & age at first marriage and y value of age at first birth in the MLR model, we want to show that as age at first marriage increases, the age at first birth also increases, which is a positive relationship between age at first marriage and age at first birth. 

Running through the whole paper, we will be introducing and analysing the details of our choice of data, the main requirements, and how we set the data in the data section, this part is for understanding the data. In model section and result section, you will be finding out the relationship between income, the age of first marriage, and the age having first child from the regression model we created. This is the most important part since it can lead to a conclusion. Moreover, the rest sections are the conclusions, the weakness of the study, data and analysis, and the subsequent work to be done. In the subsequent section, the issue of potential lurking variables are included, such as sending follow-up surveys.


## Data

Our main data requirements are an individual first marriage age and family income and having the first child age. We use dataset from General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017. In order to better do analysis on the dataset, we use gss_cleaning.R to clean the data and produce a new csv file called gss.csv and analyze on this file. 

The population is all people that has a child in 2017.  
The frame is the people who has child and received the General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017. 
The sample is people who has a child and done the General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017.

The responents were found through the General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017. The key features of our data is that it includes the responents of all the province of Canada so it should have a good representation to reflect the relationship between of first marriage age & family income and having the first child age. The weakness is that all collected Data has many NAs and there are only 4049 sample size.It might not be big enough to represent the relationship.  

The data we use to do the analysis is "age_at_first_birth", "age_at_first_marriage", "income_family" columns from gss.csv. "age_at_first_birth" represents an individual age,in years,when he/she has first child; "age_at_first_marriage" represents an individual age,in years,when he/she first got marriaged. "Income_family" has 6 categories:"Less than \$25,000", "\$25,000 to \$49,999", "\$50,000 to \$74,999", "\$75,000 to \$99,999", "\$100,000 to \$ 124,999", "$125,000 and more". For eaiser analysis, we created a new varibale called "income_level" for the data. It has 6 numbers,from 0 to 5 and corresponds the 6 categories of "Income_family" we introduced above respectively. For example, 0 income level means "Less than \$25,000" family income.

```{r,include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
gss = read_csv("gss.csv")
#note here we create a new column income: the higher income is,the higher the income family is 
cleaned_gss_data = gss %>% filter(age_at_first_birth!='NA')%>%
  filter(age_at_first_marriage!='NA')%>%
  filter(income_family!='NA')%>%
  select(age_at_first_birth, income_family,age_at_first_marriage)%>%
  mutate(income_level = case_when(income_family == "Less than $25,000" ~ 0,
                                  income_family == "$25,000 to $49,999" ~ 1,
                                  income_family == "$50,000 to $74,999" ~ 2,
                                  income_family == "$75,000 to $99,999" ~ 3,
                                  income_family == "$100,000 to $ 124,999" ~ 4,
                                  income_family == "$125,000 and more" ~5 ))

```
There is the scatter plot of what the data looks like:  
```{r}
plot(cleaned_gss_data[c(1,3,4)],main = "Figure1 :Scatter plot of data")

```



## Model

We use a multiple regression model(MLR) in order to find if age at first birth has some relationships with age at first marriage and income of the family.

The general model for MLR has the form of $y={\beta_0}+{\beta_1}x_1+{\beta_1}x_2+.....+{\beta_k}x_k+e$, where:\
$y_i$ is the dependent variable\
$x$ are all independent variables\
$\beta_0$ is the intercept parameter\
$\beta_j$ for $0<j<k+1$ is the slope parameter for $x_j$\
$e$ is the random error\

It is also important to notice that we have two independent variables, age at first marriage and family income. The first variable is numeric, while the latter one is categorical. The data for family income are recorded in different ranges, such as 25,000 to 49,999, instead of continuous number, which is why we consider family income as a categorical variable. Thus, "dummy" variables coding should be used for the family income in regression. The set up is as following:
$y=\hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}x_1+ \hat{\beta_2}x_2+ \hat{\beta_3}x_3 + \hat{\beta_4}x_4 + \hat{\beta_5}x_5 + \hat{\beta_6}x_6 $

For the numeric variable, age at first marriage, it is represented by $x_1$
income_family is Less than 25,000 (income group 0) is the baseline. All "x_i = 0" when the income family is less than 25,000\
$x_2$ = 1 when income_family is of 25,000 to 49,999 (income group 1), else 0\
$x_3$ = 1 when income_family is of 50,000 to 74,999 (income group 2),else 0\
$x_4$ = 1 when income_family is of 75,000 to 99,999  (income group 3),else 0\
$x_5$ = 1 when income_family is of 100,000 to 124,999 (income group 4),else 0\
$x_6$ = 1 when income_family is of 125,000 and more (income group 5), else 0\

The last step before fitting data into the model is to introduce our hypothesis. In the MLR model, the null hypothesis is that there is no relationships between age at first marriage & family income and age at first birth. The alternate hypothesis is that there exists some relationships between age at first marriage & family income and age at first birth.

In the next section, results regarding the MLR model would be presented by running it on RStudio. Model diagnostic issues with fitted MLR would be included in the appendix. 

## Results

This is the descriptive statistics for the response variable, age at first birth. 
```{r,include=FALSE}
summary(cleaned_gss_data$age_at_first_birth)
sd(cleaned_gss_data$age_at_first_birth)

```

```{r}
df = data.frame("Min." = 18.00 , "1st Qu."=  21.50, "Median"= 24.60 , "Mean"= 25.41,
                "3rd Qu." = 28.30, "Max."= 45.00, "SD" = 5.243019 )
kable(df,caption = "Sumary of Age at First Birth")
```




This is the Scattor Plot of Ages of Having First Child and First Marriage and Income:  

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE,message=FALSE }
cleaned_gss_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age_at_first_marriage, y = age_at_first_birth)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method =lm) +
  labs(x = "Age at first marriage",
       y ="Age at first birth",
       title = "Figure 2: Scatter plot for Age at first marriage and Age at first birth")
```

As shown from the graph, there is a clear data cluster on the left side of the plot. By looking at the trend of the cluster, it is clear that as age at first marriage increases, the age at first birth also increases, which is a positive relationship between age at first marriage and age at first birth. 

Next, we will combine age at first marriage with the other explantory variable, family income, to predict the age at first birth.

The following is our model summary:  
```{r,echo=FALSE}
lmod <- lm(age_at_first_birth ~ age_at_first_marriage+ as.factor(income_level),
                 data=cleaned_gss_data)

kable(broom::tidy(lmod),caption="Table 2: Summary of regression output")
```

From Figure 1, the fitted regression line could be obtained as $\hat{y}=7.97596+0.71365x_1+0.60340x_2+0.89821x_3-0.97441x_4+0.158902x_5+2.48667x_6$

The estimate of $\beta_1$ is 0.71365, which means for one year increase in age at first marriage, the age at first birth increases by 0.71365 on average. 

The estimate of $\beta_2$ is 0.60340, which means keeping others constant, in comparison to those in income group 0, people in income group 1 would have a 0.60340 increase in age at first birth on average.

The estimate of $\beta_3$ is 0.89821, which means keeping others constant,in comparison to those in income group 0, people in income group 2 would have a 0.89821 increase in age at first birth on average.

The estimate of $\beta_4$ is 0.97441, which means keeping others constant,in comparison to those in income group 0, people in income group 3 would have a 0.97441 increase in age at first birth on average.

The estimate of $\beta_5$ is 0.158902, which means keeping others constant, in comparison to those in income group 0, people in income group 4 would have a 0.158902 increase in age at first birth on average.

The estimate of $\beta_6$ is 2.48667, which means keeping others constant, in comparison to those in income group 0, people in income group 5 would have a 2.48667 increase in age at first birth on average.

The estimate of the intercept $\beta_0$ is 7.97596. However, if age of birth is 0, then no child would be born because the parent is not existed. Therefore, the estimate of the intercept has no practical meaning.

## Discussion
From Table 1, we can see the earliest age when people have their first child is 18 and the largest age is 45. Most people have there fist child at age 25. The standard variation is 5.243019,which is pretty big.

From Figure 2, we could see there is a positive linear trend between ages of having first child and first marriage, which means that as age at first marriage increases, age at first birth goes up as well. This suggests age at first marriage might has some correlations with age at first birth. We thereby explore their relationship with the second exploratory variable, family income, which we consider is also a crucial factor that determines age at first birth.

Moving on to Table 2, we could see the results from fitting data into a MLR model. The slope parameter for age at first marriage is 0.71365, with a p-value less than 2e-16. Since the p-value is less than a significance level of 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between age at first marriage and age at first birth. Also, the slope parameter is positive, so it is consistent with our graphic interpretation from Figure 1 that age at first marriage has a positive relationship with age at first birth.

Table 2 also has the regression summary for the categorical variable, family income. It is clear that all p-values for variables of family income are less than 0.05, which is the significance level. Thus, there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between all groups of family income and age at first birth. 

It is also worth-noticing the values of $\beta$ increase for higher income group. This suggests that people with higher family income tend to have their first child when they are older than people with lower family income. 

Therefore, findings from the result sections demonstrate that age at first marriage and family income indeed are factors that contributing to the age of people when having their first child. Moreover, we find older age at first marriage and higher family income generally lead to an older age at first birth.


# Weaknesses

Limitations exist in our data and model. There are many NA value for our explanatory and dependent variables. The original gss data set has 20602 observations, but the cleaned data set used in this report only contains 4049 observations, about one fifth of the original sample size. With over 36 million total Canadian population in 2017, the reduced cleaned data set might not be a good representative for the whole population. 

In addition, when people make the decision on how old they want to have a child, there are many influencial factors besides age at first marriage and family income. In other words, we need to take into account of lurking variables. One lurking variable could be the house size at the age of having a first child. 

Lastly, the Multiple R-squared value is 0.4204, which shows that 42.04% of the variance for age at first birth is explained by our model. This value is not high, so other models such as non-linear regression models might be better to explain the relationship in data.  

# Next Steps

Subsequent works could be done to address the issue of lurking variables. One way is to send follow-up surveys to respondents from the 2017 gss study. Some additional questions could be asked, such as "what is your house size when they had their first child?", "what is the age of your partner when your first child is born?", and etc. By collecting data from these potential lurking variables, we could fit a more interesting MLR model, which also helps us to discover the factors affecting age at first birth in a comprehensive way.

## Appendix

In the appendix, we would diagnose if the MLR model is appropriate.  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lmod, main= "Figure 3:Plots about Residuals")
```

We diagnose the mutliple regression model in Figure 3. From those residual plots, we could see the model is not that perfect since there are some bad leverage points, and the standardized residuals does not show a perfect normal distribution, and the Residuals vs Fitted plot shows a little pattern. However, the model is still almost approximate since it does not break the rule much.
